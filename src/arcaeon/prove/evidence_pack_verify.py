"""`arcaeon evidence-pack verify PACK`: check an evidence pack someone handed you.

    arcaeon evidence-pack verify PACK [--json]

Step 1 (K056): rehash every file the manifest lists and compare. A changed
byte is BROKEN naming the file; a listed file that is gone is COULD NOT LOOK
`reason_word: "missing"`; a file in the pack the manifest does not list is
BROKEN (nothing vouches for it). The manifest itself is not hashed (it holds
the hashes), which is why later steps recompute what it claims from the files.

The overall verdict is the worst step: BROKEN outranks COULD NOT LOOK, which
outranks VERIFIED. COULD NOT LOOK never exits 0.

Exit codes as every verb: 0 VERIFIED, 1 BROKEN, 2 bad usage, 3 COULD NOT LOOK.
